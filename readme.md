# Michael Chan - Junior Developer

## About me
I am an aspiring junior full-stack developer, I look forward to work in the tech industry journey, applying my knowledge, skills and strengthes to become a better full-stack developer.  

I worked as an Immigration Officer in Hong Kong for the past decade. For more than four years, I worked in a team which was responsible for maintaining and developing the internal computer systems. I used my self-learning skills to research the basic life-cycle of software development and also some SQL languages so that I can maintain an effective communcation with the internal and contractor programmers, that was also essential for me to assist the system users to write the User Stories when they wanted to have an upgrade of the application.  

 When I was tasked with asylum claim assessments, I used my communication skills and empathy to build up rapport with members of the public especially the asylum claimants who were often in distress.
