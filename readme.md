## <a name="about_me">About me üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è </a>
I am an aspiring junior full-stack developer, I look forward to working in the tech industry journey, applying my knowledge, skills and strengthes to become a better full-stack developer.  

I am always fascinated with technologies, I love online shopping, I love travelling with GPS and Google Map, I love video calls or gaming with friends living in another continent. I believes technology has a great potential to change our lives. That is why after I moved from Hong Kong to the UK in January 2022, I decided to start my career in tech.

### Self-reliant 
I worked as an Immigration Officer in Hong Kong for the past decade. For more than four years, I worked as a non-technical member in a team which was responsible for maintaining and developing the internal computer systems. I had to be adaptable and self-learn the basic life-cycle of software development. Although I was not required to learn any technical aspects or programming language, I found it useful to learn the basic SQL so that I could ensure an effective communcation with the internal and contractor programmers, that was also essential for me to assist the system users to write the User Stories when they wanted to have an upgrade of the application.  

When I was tasked with asylum claim assessments, I used my communication skills and empathy to build up rapport with members of the public especially the asylum claimants who were often in distress. I used my attention to details and analytic skills in my freqeunt communication with their legal representatives and my research of the submitted evidence and the relevant Country of Origin Information.  I also used my time management skills to arrange interviews, conduct researches on cases, and write
