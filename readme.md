## <a name="about_me">About me üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è </a>
I am an aspiring junior full-stack developer. I look forward to the journey working in the tech industry, applying my knowledge, skills and strengths to become a better full-stack developer. 

I am always fascinated with technology, I love online shopping, I love travelling with GPS and Google Map, I love video calls or gaming with friends living in another continent. I believe technology has a great potential to improve our lives. That is why after I moved from Hong Kong to the UK in January 2022, I decided to explore tech as my new career.  I joined the highly-selective 16-week long bootcamp in [Makers](https://makers.tech/); while the highly intensive bootcamp confirmed my career change. Now I am ready for a challenging and rewarding career as a junior developer.

### Self-initiative and self-directed learner
I worked as an Immigration Officer in Hong Kong for the past decade. For more than four years, I worked as a non-technical member in a team which was responsible for maintaining and developing the internal computer systems. I had to be adaptable and self-learn the basic life-cycle of software development. Although I was not required to learn any technical aspects or programming language, I found it useful to learn the basic SQL so that I could ensure an effective communication with the internal and contractor programmers, that was also essential for me to assist the system users to write the User Stories when they wanted to have an upgrade of the application. 

My team used React Native, which was not included in the Makers official curriculum, in the Engineering Project III in the Makers bootcamp. I used my self-directed learning skill, together with my team, to learn and apply the newly learnt languages to build two mobile applications and successfully tested them on physical devices.

### Communication, empathy, and construtive team player
During the Makers bootcamp, I pair programmed almost every day. We had 3 group projects. I used my communication skills to complete our tasks by learning together and overcoming obstacles. When there was a knowledge spectrum across the groups, I listened to what obstacles my partners had and tried to progress together as a team. 

When I worked in the team with programmers and system users, I always had to use my communication skills to understand the needs of the system users, assist them to write User Stories, and to explain to the programmers who did not have experience or full understanding of the users' daily operations. I also needed to explain system constraints to users and assist them to adjust the scope of possible system change. 

When I was tasked with asylum claim assessments, I frequently interviewed the asylum claimants who were often in distress. I used my communication skills and empathy to build up rapport with them so that they can give their evidence to support their claims as best as they could.

### Attention to details and analytical skills
In the Makers bootcamp, I had coding sessions reviewed by independent external reviewers. In the latest review on 11 July 2022, I was commented as "reasoned well and justified all the decisions [I] made regarding [my] algorithm. Even when stuck, [I] still justified and reasoned every attempt that [I] made at a solution to the non-compliant test."

In my job as Immigration Officer to assess asylum claims, I used my attention to details and analytic skills in my frequent communication with their legal representatives and my research of the submitted evidence and the relevant Country of Origin Information. 

### Time management and prioritising
In the Engineering Projects in Makers bootcamp, I always used time management skills to build web applications in relatively limited time with my team using the newly learnt skills. My team and I always had to make decisions on which tasks should be completed first. We also had to prioritise different features, bug fixes, or learning new techs for the project.

When I worked as an Immigration Officer to assess asylum claims, I usually had around 8 to 10 cases of different stages under my care. I used my time management skills to arrange interviews, conduct research on cases, write decisions, and to handle appeals of asylum claimants within the pledge timeframe. I had to use my time management skill to finish all tasks on time.
