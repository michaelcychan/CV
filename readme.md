## <a name="about_me">About me üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è </a>
I am an aspiring junior full-stack developer, I look forward to working in the tech industry journey, applying my knowledge, skills and strengthes to become a better full-stack developer.  

I am always fascinated with technologies, I love online shopping, I love travelling with GPS and Google Map, I love video calls or gaming with friends living in another continent. I believes technology has a great potential to improve our lives. That is why after I moved from Hong Kong to the UK in January 2022, I decided to explore tech as my new career.  I joined the highly-selective 16-week long bootcmap in [Makers](https://makers.tech/), which was highly intensive, but it confirmed my career change. I am ready for a challenging and rewarding career as a junior developer.

## <a name="skills">Skills üèπ</a>

### Self-initiative and self-directed learner
I worked as an Immigration Officer in Hong Kong for the past decade. For more than four years, I worked as a non-technical member in a team which was responsible for maintaining and developing the internal computer systems. I had to be adaptable and self-learn the basic life-cycle of software development. Although I was not required to learn any technical aspects or programming language, I found it useful to learn the basic SQL so that I could ensure an effective communcation with the internal and contractor programmers, that was also essential for me to assist the system users to write the User Stories when they wanted to have an upgrade of the application.  

My team used React Native, which was not taught officially, in the Engineering Project III  in the Makers bootcamp. I used my self-directed learning skill to learn and apply the newly learnt langauge to build two mobile applications and succesfully tested them on physical devices.

### Communication, empathy, and construtive team player
During the Makers bootcamp, I pair programmed almost every day. We had 3 group projects. I used my communication skills to complete our tasks by learning together and overcoming obstacles. When there was knowledge spectrum across the groups, I listened to what obstacles my partners had and tried to progress together as a team.  
When I worked in the team with programmers and system users, I always had to use my communication skills to understand the need of the system users, assist them to write User Stories, and to explain to the programmers who did not have experience or full understanding of the users' daily operations. I also needed to explain system contrains to users and assist them to adjust the scope of possible system change.  

When I was tasked with asylum claim assessments, I used my communication skills and empathy to build up rapport with members of the public especially the asylum claimants who were often in distress.

### Attention to details and analytical skills
I used my attention to details and analytic skills in my freqeunt communication with their legal representatives and my research of the submitted evidence and the relevant Country of Origin Information.  I also used my time management skills to arrange interviews, conduct researches on cases, and write
